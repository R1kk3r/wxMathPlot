0.02 Release notes
------------------

While the project has been idle for about 4 years, this release simply fixes
some thing to adapt to new versions of wxWidgets. The use of deprecated
classes or method has been corrected. Only a simple method for layer
counting has been added.

wxMathPlot now works on Linux (tested for Mepis 6.5 and Debian Etch using
wxGTK-2.6), and Windows (built under XP using Visual Studio Express 2005).
If you experience to test it under other platform, please write me at:
cdron77(at)sourceforge.net
